# STM32F446RE Bare-Metal Drivers üöÄ

This repository contains a collection of bare-metal (register-level) embedded C projects for the **STM32F446RE** microcontroller, developed without using STM32 HAL or CMSIS-Driver libraries. It is focused on learning, testing, and demonstrating the use of on-chip peripherals directly via register programming.
